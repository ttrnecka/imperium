Tournament - add new Target value and create 6 ranges for blessings/curses that assign points
           - deck will show what range you are in

           - blessing/curses rolled in inducement phase in the order
           - admincomp update - make the table updates not to remove/reinsert things
           - add feature to include staff from HC in the deck builder

          - update deck reset to clear squad as well

Tournament Template - add ranges

Conclave 
        achievements - change to curse/blessing points

HC
 - starts with 1 slot
 - level to X slots - what is the price per slot?, what is the cap?
 - frontend view and level ability
 - staff has limited use
    deduct use after staff is included in tournamnet
    add use after staff is removed from tournamnets (in deck building phase only obviously)
    once staff is use in first tournament card cannot be dusted anymore
    HC cards should act as normal card - for example be announced
    HC cards are displayed in the collection
     - staff has limited use
    you can use only subset of your staff in HC for given tournament - so only use 2 staff cards from 3 in the HC for a tournament for example
